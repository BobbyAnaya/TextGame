# TextGame
A text-based game written in Python. This project was made solely to practice different programming concepts.


Just a couple of notes 11/2/17:

1. Much of the format displayed in each room (function) differ from each other. This inconsistency is due to
    experimenting with different ways to make the function more efficient.

2. Everything in this project could probably be cleaner and more efficient if I used classes. My plan is to slowly
    rewrite everything with classes.

3. Many of the loops have redundancies. Cleaning these up can be added to the to do list.

4. The overall code needs to be cleaned up for readability reasons
